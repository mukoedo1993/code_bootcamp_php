/*
Stacks can be implemented using both arrays and linked lists.
In this case, both arrays and link lists are going to work fairly well.

Arrays allow something called cache locality, which makes them 
technically faster when accessing its items in memory because
they're right next to each other versus a linked list that has 
them scattered all over memory.
Also, linked list has extra memory associated with them because we have to 
hold on to those pointers.
But on the other hand, they have more dynamic memory.

/*
You will never want to build a queue based on an array, or if you do
well, that is not necessarily a good idea.
Because erase in an array could be O(n), but in a linked list for the current
first enqueued element is O(1).
Arrays have indexes associated with them.

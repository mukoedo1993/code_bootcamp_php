//Interview questions to choose between BFS and dfs

1: If you know a solution is not far from the root of the tree:
BFS. 
Because it starts searching the closest nodes to the parent first.


2: If the tree is very deep and solutions are rare:
We will use BFS. 
Reason: Because solutions are rare, it is most likely going to just repeat
that step over and over and over.


3: If the tree is very wide:
DFS (BFS will need too much memory)

4: If solutions are frequent but located deep in the tree:
DFS. So hopefully we could find a quicker answer.

5: Find the shortest path:
BFS
